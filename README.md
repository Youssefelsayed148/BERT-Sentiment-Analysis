# 📌 BERT-Sentiment-Analysis

This project implements a **BERT-based Sentiment Analysis** model deployed as a **Dockerized API** with a **Gradio** web interface.  
It allows users to input text and instantly receive a sentiment prediction (**Positive / Negative / Neutral**).

## 📖 Key Features
- **BERT Transformer Model** for high-accuracy NLP.
- **Class imbalance handling** during training using `class_weight`.
- **Gradio Interface** for interactive predictions.
- **Docker Deployment** for easy sharing and portability.

## 🛠️ Approach

### **Data Preprocessing**
- Tokenized text using Hugging Face’s `BertTokenizer`.
- Lowercasing, cleaning, and truncating to `max_length=128`.

### **Handling Class Imbalance**
- Calculated the distribution of classes.
- Applied class weights in the loss function during training.

### **Model Training**
- **Base model:** `bert-base-uncased`
- **Optimizer:** `AdamW`
- **Loss:** Weighted Cross Entropy (with class weights)
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, F1-score

### **Deployment**
- Built `main.py` (FastAPI + Gradio) for the backend and UI.
- Created a `Dockerfile` to package the app, model, and dependencies.
- Exposed **port 7860** for the Gradio interface.

## 📊 Evaluation

The model achieved **82% accuracy** on the test set.

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| 0     | 0.75      | 0.87   | 0.80     |
| 1     | 0.90      | 0.83   | 0.86     |
| 2     | 0.72      | 0.80   | 0.76     |

**Weighted Avg F1:** 0.83

## 🔧 Model Optimization Ideas
- Increase training epochs to allow the model more learning time.
- Adjust learning rate (try smaller values for fine-tuning stability).
- Experiment with different optimizers.
- Handle class imbalance using oversampling.
- Use more training data or augment text data with paraphrasing techniques.
- Experiment with different pre-trained BERT variants (e.g., DistilBERT for speed, RoBERTa for accuracy).
